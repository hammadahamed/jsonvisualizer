### Techs used
The app use `REACT (Typescript)` for frontend and `Zustand` for the state management. 

Built this tool to learn REACT. Where's fun in learning something without building something.

So thank my enthu for creating this wonderful application and also, @jsoncrack repo which gave this project idea.
This is my own implementation using RAW Data Structures. So, No complaints on Performance difference or features ;)

`What's differenct from the project's inspiration ?`
- Better relative postitioning (Achieved with close parsing on on Raw json)
- Better fault tolerance
